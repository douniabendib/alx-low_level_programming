<br><h1> SEARCH ALGORITHMS </h1>
A search algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or method used to locate specific information or find solutions to a problem within a given set of data. It is commonly employed in computer science and information retrieval to efficiently search through large amounts of data or to find optimal solutions in various domains.

Search algorithms are designed to systematically explore the search space, which is the collection of all possible states or configurations that can be reached during the search process. The goal is to find a desired target or satisfy certain conditions.

There are several types of search algorithms, each suited to different problem domains and search space characteristics. Some common search algorithms include:

Linear Search: This is a simple algorithm that checks each element in a list or sequence one by one until the target element is found or the entire list is traversed.

Binary Search: This algorithm is applicable to sorted lists or arrays. It repeatedly divides the search space in half by comparing the target value with the middle element, discarding the half that cannot contain the target.

Depth-First Search (DFS): This algorithm explores a graph or tree structure by traversing as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is often used to find paths or explore all possible solutions.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): This algorithm explores a graph or tree in a breadthward motion, examining all the neighbors of a node before moving to the next level. It is commonly used to find the shortest path or to explore all nodes at a given depth level.

A* Search: This is an informed search algorithm that combines elements of both DFS and BFS. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of reaching the goal and guides the search towards the most promising paths.
